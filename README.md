# Financial Modeling for Option Pricing  

This project explores the application of the **Heston Stochastic Volatility Model** for option pricing, combining traditional finance theories with machine learning techniques. The project includes Monte Carlo simulations and model calibration for accurate option pricing.  

## Overview  

- **Objective**: Implement and analyze the Heston model for option pricing using Monte Carlo simulations and calibration techniques.  
- **Approach**:  
  1. Monte Carlo Simulation for option pricing using the Heston model.  
  2. Model calibration using market data to improve pricing accuracy.
